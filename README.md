___

Game project for the *2019 Game Gig Countdown Edition Hackathon* at the *Computer Labs* in the *University of Cambridge*. Team members are *Gavin Choy* and *Hui Taou Kok*.

This is a game where the player is the bicycle starting at the bottom of the window. The player needs to ride their bicycle to the top of the window within a duration of time (a countdown timer was set to be 30 seconds) in order to win.

This game is set on King's Parade which is a street in Cambridge that is notorious for pedestrians crossing the street. It is intended to be impossible to win the game because there are too many pedestrians crossing the road!

A video demonstration is available by clicking the image below:
